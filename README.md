Tydeligvis kan ikke login ligge i en controller

## RESOURCES, INSPIRATION, AND COLLABORATIONS
### CODE
**Gerardo de La Riva**
Parts of the code are similar to the code provided by Gerardo de La Riva during the lectures. I have used codes from March 10th and March 17th.

### COLLABORATIONS
During the weekend of week 11, Glenn and I met up to work on the assignment together. We wrote our own code but helped each other when we didn't get the code to work. Because of this, some of our codes might be similar.

### RESOURCES
During development I have taken inspiration and methods from the link below, therefore, some of the code might be similar.
